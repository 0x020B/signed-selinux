Subject: [PATCH 4/5] libsemanage: save homedir_template in the policy store
 for genhomedircon

We don't currently store homedir_template in the policy store, which
means genhomedircon only has a template file to use if the
homedir_template was generated from the file contexts in the same
transaction.  But homedir_template isn't always generated, as in the
case with setsebool -P. In this and other cases, genhomedircon will not
have a template file resulting in an empty file_contexts.homedir file.

This commit changes this so that homedir_template is always stored in
the policy store so it can be used by genhomedircon regardless of how
policy was built. Also add the homedir_template file to the migration
script.
